                    <p>The Olive Ridley turtle is the smallest of the sea turtles found in Sri Lanka. Also known commonly as the PACIFIC RIDLEY SEA TURTLE. Is a species of turtle in the family Cheloniidae.They are named after their olive-coloured shell and can weigh up to 50 kilograms. The Olive Ridley turtle is a vulnerable species due to their nesting behaviour. Unlike the Green turtle, Olive Ridley turtles nest in large groups known as arribadas.Olive Ridley Turtles nest yearly and many lay their eggs on Kosgoda Beach, depositing more than 150 at one time. They are omnivores, eating crustaceans, fish and some marine vegetation. This critically endangered turtle is the largest of the 5 species and is a rare find in Sri Lanka. </p>

                    <p>The Leatherback Sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is regarded as the fourth-heaviest modern reptile and the largest living turtle.They are named after their leathery skin, unique among sea turtles. It may be identified by its big, teardrop-shaped body that is a massive shade of grayish-black and is coated in skin and greasy flesh, as well as by the seven distinct ridges that run along its body from front to back. The leatherback sea turtle can reach heights of up to seven feet (two meters) and can weigh over two thousand pounds (900 kilograms). It can swim swiftly through the water thanks to its hydrodynamic body structure and a sizable pair of front flippers because it primarily feeds on jellyfish and other small marine invertebrates.  Leatherback turtles are rare in Sri Lanka and are mainly found in the island’s northern waters. </p>
